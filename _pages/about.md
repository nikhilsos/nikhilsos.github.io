## What I Do  

- ðŸŽ“ **Research:** I have worked on projects in Pine Wilt disease (PWD) detection, where we identify classify and segment the trees affected by PWD. Contrastive Learning and Metric Learning are some ideas that I find cool.
I've also worked on Music Information Retrieval (MIR), My work focused on beat tracking with TCN-transformer hybrid, I have expanded my work to include downbeat tracking in traditional Korean folk music called Pansori. I want to write more about it in my blogs, if I don't procrastinate. 
- ðŸŽ¶ **Music:** I love music, I also make them and find AI applications in Music intriguing. I used to make hiphop music but I've taken a break lately, maybe I'd resume if Iget time or don't procrastinate.
-  ðŸ“š **Reading:** I love reading books, specially on philosophy.
