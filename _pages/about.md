## About Me  
I hold a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), South Korea.

I am a Research Assistant at AILab, led by Prof. Dr. Lee Joon Whoan 

My passions lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Music Informatics**, fueled by a love for hip-hop—I’ve even dabbled in writing and producing music. 

Currently, I’m into AI research and development to amplify human creativity and solve some real world problems.

## What I Do  

- I have worked on projects in Pine Wilt disease (PWD) detection, where we identify classify and segment the trees affected by PWD. Contrastive Learning and Metric Learning are some ideas that I find cool.

- I've also worked on Music Information Retrieval (MIR), My work focused on beat tracking with TCN-transformer hybrid, I have expanded my work to include downbeat tracking in traditional Korean folk music called Pansori. I want to write more about it in my blogs, if I don't procrastinate. 

- I love music, I also make them and find AI applications in Music intriguing. I used to make hip-hop music but I've taken a break recently, maybe I'd resume if I get time or don't procrastinate.I like reading books, specially on philosophy. I like the thoughts from Advaita Vedanta.
