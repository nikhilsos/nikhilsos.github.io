###   

I've always been drawn to poetry, which evolved into a deep connection with hip-hop over the years. Self-taught through countless YouTube tutorials, I learned beat-making, mixing, and mastering, eventually experimenting with creating my own songs.  

While I haven't been actively producing music recently, here’s a glimpse of what I’ve worked on over the years. Some pieces date back 5 years! 

You can check out my [youTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nikhilthapa9300)

The lyrics are in Nepali, English, or a mix of both, note that some tracks might contain explicit language.  

### My Music and Beats..
Some of the music I created is in this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-1ZAXA0Lm69u1uW1hGew-RddtWR4loV?usp=sharing). I have not produced recently as I have been busy with my university work.  
Feel free to explore and enjoy!
