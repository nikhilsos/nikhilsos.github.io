### Music Portfolio  

I've always been drawn to poetry, which evolved into a deep connection with hip-hop over the years. Self-taught through countless YouTube tutorials, I learned beat-making, mixing, and mastering, eventually experimenting with creating my own songs.  

While I haven't been actively producing music recently, here’s a glimpse of what I’ve worked on over the years. Some pieces date back 5 years! The lyrics are in Nepali, English, or a mix of both—note that some tracks contain explicit language.
